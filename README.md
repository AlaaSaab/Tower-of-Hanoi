  - Moving discs between three towers while following the rules.
  - Interactive input for selecting source and destination towers.
- Graphical representation using the `turtle` module:
  - Dynamic visualization of the towers, discs, and moves.
  - Animations for gameplay and the automatic solution.
- Undo functionality to reverse the last move.
- Score tracking and display based on the number of moves and time taken.
- Automatic recursive solution for optimal gameplay demonstration.
